# Employee Tracker
The following application is a databased schema using MYSQL. For many developers, it is important that they are able to view and manage their departments, roles, and employees in the company so that they can organize and plan their businesses well.

# App Functionality
To run the app, open the file and type "node index.js" in the terminal, ensuring that you are inside of the index.js folder. This will prompt the user with a series of options that they may click on. They can VIEW, ADD, or UPDATE either the roles, employees, or departments. 

* Use the [MySQL](https://www.npmjs.com/package/mysql) NPM package to connect to your MySQL database and perform queries.

* Use [InquirerJs](https://www.npmjs.com/package/inquirer/v/0.2.3) NPM package to interact with the user via the command-line.

* Use [console.table](https://www.npmjs.com/package/console.table) to print MySQL rows to the console. There is a built-in version of `console.table`, but the NPM package formats the data a little better for our purposes.
